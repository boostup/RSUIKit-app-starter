This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

[Guide available here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

[This app is made following this tutorial](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/create-a-new-reactjs-app.html)

#Intro
This package is meant as a starter kit for creating react apps for the browser.

#Features
- Bootstrap for react
- Routing
- Auto selecting nav item of main nav, according to URL/href
- CSS imports using regular ES6 import statements
- Passing App-level data or functions to routes' child component (useful for passing user session data for example)

#Roadmap
- Make an app level loading indicator for API requests
- [Make components loadable through ES6 'import' statements using 'react-loadable'](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/code-splitting-in-create-react-app.html#nextsteps), but watch for 'Webpack loaders are not supported by Create React App.' [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/2477)
- is ES6 await/async??

#Useful tools
- [Defining favicons](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/add-app-favicons.html)
