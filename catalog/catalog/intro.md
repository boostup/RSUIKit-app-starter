The app starter includes the **'RSUIKit (React Semantic UI Kit)'** npm package, a bunch of useful and a set of [features](#features) which help put real working apps together with performance in mind, really quickly.

# About CSS pre-processing
The guys at [Create React App provide sensible reasons](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc) for not needing any CSS pre-processor, and I tend to agree. Of course, this can be openly discussed.
